Possible improvements to apt-transport-sftp
(patches or donations to make these happen are most wellcome)


* Currently we use libssh2 in blocking mode for simplicity.
  Using non-blocking mode should achieve a significant speedup
  especially with newer versions of libssh2 due to the way
  SFTP works. Tuning the buffer size or switching to a dynamic
  buffer should also improve speed.

* Support password-based auth (using netrc?)

* Support ssh-agent based auth

* Support the "Pipeline" feature that some other apt methods
  support (e.g., the HTTP and HTTPS methods)

* More tests including performance tests (e.g., to measure the
  performance impact of non-blocking mode). 

* Ask (once more) for libssh2 to become part of ubuntu "main"?

* Rework the code to submit to upstream apt
