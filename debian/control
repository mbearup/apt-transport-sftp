Description: SFTP transport method for APT
 This package provides an sftp transport method for APT. In contrast
 to the ssh method, sftp doesn't require shell access to the server,
 allows for easier chroot'ing and in general provides administrative
 advantages.
 .
 The URIs supported are of the form "sftp://host:port/foo distro main"
 Since sftp typically requires authentication you will need to set the
 access details for this method (e.g., location of public/private keys
 as appropriate) in apt.conf. See apt.conf-sftp(5) and the example in
 /usr/share/doc/apt-transport-sftp for how to do this.
